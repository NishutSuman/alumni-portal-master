# alumni-portal-master
This is a master version of Navodaya Alumni Portal which will be scaled and maintained for future use.


Hey, recently I have implemented the individual membership system with the previous chat. I have updated the all the code to GitHub repo and synced with the project already. Please check the enitre code base and audit it properly along with all the changes made with my receent last commit.

Few non negotiable rule for you:
- Before starting wth any problem, go through the existing codes on repo and the pdfs if provided in the project. Then understand clearly and map the requirement and then only start coding.
- Do not use my main thread of the conversation as it kills my max usage limit. So try to avoid it.
- Whatever your suggested code and summaries, please provide in artifacts
- Do not generate unnecessary codes or summaries
- Follow the existing code structure, import, export and file names properly.
- Always while generating code take reference from existing file. Check if such thing already exists in the code.

POTENTIAL ISSUES:
- For Membership and BatchAdmi payment (reference type), why there is no update in CalculatePayementTotal() in payment.controller.
